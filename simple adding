SIMPLE ADDING
Using the JavaScript language, have the function SimpleAdding(num) add up all the numbers from 1 to num. For the test cases, the parameter num will be any number from 1 to 1000.

SOLUTION
This was probably one of the more straight forward problems I've encountered on Coderbyte (since I'm a beginner, that's nice once and awhile).
  1) Create a new number variable and set it to 0.
  2) Build a for loop that starts at 1 (since the problem states to start at one) and exits the loop once i = num.
  3) Increment the new number variable with each cycle (ie newNum += i)

function SimpleAdding(num) { 

  var newNum = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    newNum += i;
  }
  return newNum; 
         
}
