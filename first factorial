//FIRST FACTORIAL
//Using the JavaScript language, have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it (ie. if num = 4, return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)). For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18.

//SOLUTION
//So this immediately made me realize that I'd need a modified for loop that starts at either the beginning (i = 1) or end (i = num) and works its way up/down. Then I simply multiply my new variable with each loop to get the final number.
//1) Create a number variable and set to 1
//2) Build a for loop at either starts at the beginning (1) or end (num)
//3) Multiple the new number variable by each interation of the loop

function FirstFactorial(num) { 
  
  var newNum = 1;
  for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    newNum *= i;
  }
  return newNum; 
         
}
